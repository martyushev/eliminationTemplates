Software required: Maple 2021+


How to use:

1) Formulating minimal problems as (Laurent) polynomial systems
 1.1) See examples in ../problems/

2) Finding, reducing and saving elimination templates
 2.1) Configure parameters in redundantAG.ini
 2.2) Run Maple and open templateFinder.mw
 2.3) Pick minimal problem (prob := "problem_name")
 2.4) Enter templateFinder(prob): Note that
  - it can be interrupted at any time
  - found templates are stored in the global variable TD of type Array
  - found templates are not saved automatically to a file
 2.5) Select the template for reduction (td := TD[i])
 2.6) Enter templateReduction(prob, td): Note that
  - it can be interrupted at any time
  - reduced template is stored in the global variable td1 of type list
  - reduced template is not saved automatically to a file
 2.7) Enter saveTemplate(prob, td1): Note that
  - reduced template is saved to templates/t_prob
  - existing template file will be overwritten

3) Generating solver and/or related files from the saved template
 3.1) Configure parameters in redundantAG.ini
 3.2) Run Maple and open solverGenerator.mw
 3.3) Pick minimal problem (prob := "problem_name")
 3.4) Enter solverGenerator(prob): Note that
  - solver and related files are generated in ../solvers.language/prob, where language is one of matlab, julia, python
  - existing files will be overwritten
  - solver file cannot be created for incomplete templates
  - for positive-dimensional systems with 0-dimensional components, the number of roots is always set to 1 and should be changed manually in the test file
